**Introducing Coderoad**: a social media platform designed specifically for **bootcamp graduates** stepping into the world of tech. Coderoad doubles as a learning platform, offering a delightful experience for new developers embarking on their careers.

### Coderoad enables users to:

- **Connect and engage with the community**
- **Search for Jobs**
- **Prepare effectively for Job interviews**
- **Reinforce and practice their coding skills**

This app was realized and released as a [demo version](https://coderoad.onrender.com/) as a graduation project for the "Web-App Development Coding Bootcamp" at WBS Coding School, Berlin in August 2023. It was developed entirely from the conceptual phase, including Scrum management and Sprint Planning, until its fully functional production deployment.

 It was a collaborative team effort involving talented classmates Marie Hink and Omar Al Zoubi.
**Disclaimer:** Despite its full functionalities, the App is a Demo version and should be used only for personal consideration purposes. The developers deny any responsibilities for any misuse.
